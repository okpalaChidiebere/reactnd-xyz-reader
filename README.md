# Shared Element Transitions
- For this app, implementing the Shared Element did not workout well. On my own free time i will try to re-implement [this app](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-native-shared-element/tree/master/test-app) which will help me understand Shared Element for React native in full
- NOTE: it is important you run `yarn add react-native-shared-element react-navigation-shared-element@next` as stated in this [article](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-use-shared-element-transition-with-react-navigation-v5/) to install the package for your app. It still dont not stop you from using react navigation screen transitions though :). If you are still getting an error after installation follow this [step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUAle04RTvk)
